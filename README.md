üá¨üáß Welcome to [WebValley](https://webvalley.fbk.eu) Python Programming Class! The class is meant for absolute beginners and code practictioners who are willing to move their first steps into with the [Python](https://python.org) programming language.

### <a name="descr-eng">About üá¨üáß</a>

During the workshop, we will design an innovative **Pok√©mon** [Search Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine).

This engine will feature a special and super secret technology that is capable of retrieving the `k` most similar Pok√©mons with respect to the [_search query_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval).

We will design and implement _step-by-step_ this core technology in order to calculate the similarities between any pair of Pok√©mons, either existing or _imaginary_ ones, as identified by a specified set of characteristics.

üßë‚Äçüíª **Happy coding!** üë©‚Äçüíª

#### Curious to know more? (‚ö†Ô∏è SPOILER ALERT)

We will be working on our implementation of the [KNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors), a very popular and simple [Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) algorithm designed to measure the distances between points in N-dimensional spaces.

Each `Pok√©mon` in our dataset will be denoted by the following set of _features_:

```
* HP (hit points)
* Attack
* Defense
* Special attack
* Special defense
* Speed
```

The goal of the algorithm is to compare the values of each of those characteristics, and return the `k` _most similar_ pok√©mons (i.e. the ones at closest distance) given
an input search query.

#### Tools

We won't be using any external libraries or software. Everything will be implemented in pure Python, using all the _batteries already included_ in the language stack.

The development environment used throughout the workshop will be [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).
